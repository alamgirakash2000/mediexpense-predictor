### About the project

This is a project to learn Linear Regression and apply it with Scikit-Learn.
Here, we have created a model for an Health Insurance company to estimate the
annual medical expenditure for new customers, using information such as their
age, sex, BMI, children, smoking habits and region of residence. In this project
we have applied Linear Regression with both One variable and Multiple variables.
We also have tested the model with the help of Scikit-learn and calculated the
Training Loss and Test Loss

### Technologies:

- This machine learning model is created with the Multiple Variable linear
  regression algorithm.
- This frontend is created with React and Next js framework
- The RESTful api backend is created with Python Flask Framework
